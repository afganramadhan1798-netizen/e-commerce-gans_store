## Repositories

| Component | Repository |
|---|---|
| Frontend | Add your frontend repository URL here |
| Backend | [backend-ecom-gans_store](https://github.com/afganramadhan1798-netizen/backend-ecom-gans_store) |

## Database Structure

The application uses MySQL with the following main tables:

| Table | Description |
|---|---|
| users | User account information |
| user_addresses | Customer addresses |
| categories | Product categories |
| products | Product information |
| carts | Shopping carts |
| cart_items | Cart items |
| wishlists | Customer wishlist |
| orders | Customer orders |
| order_items | Order details |
| personal_access_tokens | Laravel Sanctum tokens |

Laravel supporting tables are also used for migrations, sessions, cache, and job processing.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to run the application locally.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:

- PHP 8.3 or higher.
- Composer.
- Node.js and npm.
- MySQL.
- Git.
- Laragon or another local development environment.

### 1. Clone the Backend Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/afganramadhan1798-netizen/backend-ecom-gans_store.git

cd backend-ecom-gans_store
```

### 2. Install Backend Dependencies

```bash
composer install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` into `.env`.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Configure your local database connection:

```env
APP_NAME="Gan's Store"
APP_ENV=local
APP_DEBUG=true
APP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=gans_store_backend
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

Update the database values according to your local MySQL configuration.

### 4. Generate Application Key

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

### 5. Run Database Migrations

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

If you have a database backup containing existing project data, import it into MySQL before using the application with that data.

### 6. Create Storage Link

```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

This command allows publicly accessible product images stored on Laravel's public disk to be served through the application.

### 7. Start Laravel Server

```bash
php artisan serve
```

The backend API will be available at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api
```

## Frontend Setup

Clone your frontend repository separately.

```bash
git clone YOUR_FRONTEND_REPOSITORY_URL
cd YOUR_FRONTEND_PROJECT_FOLDER
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the frontend project root:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/api
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at the local URL provided by Vite.

## API Authentication

Gan's Store uses Laravel Sanctum for API authentication.

After successful login, the frontend receives an authentication token and sends it with protected API requests through the Authorization header.

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
Accept: application/json
```

Protected endpoints require a valid authentication token.

## Main API Endpoints

### Public Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint |
|---|---|
| POST | `/api/register` |
| POST | `/api/login` |
| GET | `/api/products` |
| GET | `/api/products/{product}` |
| GET | `/api/categories` |

### Customer Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint |
|---|---|
| GET | `/api/user` |
| POST | `/api/logout` |
| GET | `/api/orders` |
| POST | `/api/orders` |
| GET | `/api/cart` |
| POST | `/api/cart/items` |
| GET | `/api/wishlist` |
| POST | `/api/wishlist` |
| GET | `/api/address` |
| PUT | `/api/address` |

### Admin Endpoints

|---|---|
| GET | `/api/admin/users` |
| PATCH | `/api/admin/users/{id}/role` |
| PATCH | `/api/admin/users/{id}/status` |
| GET | `/api/admin/products` |

| PUT | `/api/admin/categories/{category}` |
| DELETE | `/api/admin/categories/{category}` |

| PATCH | `/api/admin/orders/{order}/status` |

## Security Notes

- Never commit `.env` files containing credentials.
- Keep application keys and database passwords private.
- Protected API routes use Laravel Sanctum authentication.
- Admin endpoints require administrator authorization.
- User account status is checked by the backend middleware.

## Development Notes

- Frontend and backend are maintained in separate repositories.
- The backend communicates with the frontend through REST API.
- Axios is used for HTTP communication.
- Product images are managed through Laravel's public storage disk.
- MySQL is used as the primary database.

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements include:

- Payment gateway integration.
- Shipping service integration.
- Product reviews and ratings.
- Order notifications.
- Sales analytics dashboard.
- Improved mobile experience.
